## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SAAS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Gulp
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use positions absolutes and relatives, also learned how to create figures with CSS.

```css
    Parent
    position: relative;

    Child
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    right: 0rem;
    top: 16rem;
    width: 65%;
    height: 15rem;
    background: hsl(231, 69%, 60%);
    z-index: -2;
    border-top-left-radius: 30% 50%;
    border-bottom-left-radius: 30% 50%;
```

### Continued development

- I still need to learn how to refactor the code better.
- Also i need to learn how to plain the projects better.
- Another important point is Git and Github. I had a lot of problems due to i cloned my project on another computer and it was difficult for me to go back to using Git Push.
- The final Point is that still i need to improve my english :p.
